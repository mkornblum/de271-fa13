<h3>Course Description</h3>

<p>Through lectures, demonstrations, and hands on projects, students
learn the basics of interactive publishing. Students create their own
website and learn the basics of interactive design including HTML,
CSS, javascript, and other industry web standards.</p>

<h3>Course Objectives</h3>

<p>This course provides an overview of interactive design concepts and
applications, with a specific focus on the web. Topics include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Structure of the Internet; hardware and software that make up the web</li>
<li>HTML basics; semantics, syntax, how to read it and write it</li>
<li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</li>
<li>Wireframing and user experience design (UX)</li>
<li>Design for multiple devices &ndash; tablets, smartphones, desktop browsers</li>
</ul>


<h3>Course Learning Outcomes</h3>

<p>Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Understand the Internet&rsquo;s structure and components</li>
<li>Build a fully functional web site using HTML and CSS</li>
<li>Successfully identify key elements in the design of interactive
applications</li>
<li>Understand common practices and processes employed in the
design and development of web applications</li>
<li>Contribute effectively to an iterative project workflow</li>
</ul>


<h3>Course Format</h3>

<ul>
<li>Demonstrations, class discussions, and critiques &ndash; Some days, I&rsquo;ll
demonstrate things on the projector, and you will follow along on your
computer and ask me questions. On other days, your classmates will
present their work for critique. You will critique it thoughtfully
and compassionately.</li>
<li>Homework Assignments &ndash; Projects must be completed on time. If you
aren&rsquo;t going to complete a project on time, let me know as soon as
possible. I generally try to be flexible, but that&rsquo;s easier when I
am not chasing you, wondering where your work is.</li>
<li>In class projects &ndash; there will be a number of studio periods, during
which time you will work individually or in groups, and I&rsquo;ll help you
as necessary. It is important that you make good use of this time &ndash;
my observations of your focus (or lack thereof) during studio time
will impact your professionalism and participation grades.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Assignments:</h4>

<p>There are 2 larger assignments:</p>

<ol>
<li>Food Packaging as a Website (HTML and CSS specific)</li>
<li>Interactive prototype application (final class project)</li>
</ol>

</ul>


<h3>Department Policies</h3>

<h4>Professional Courtesy</h4>

<p>Professionalism in the workplace is expressed through dependability
and behavior that accords with high personal
standards. Professionalism in the classroom is no different, but can
be extended to include respect for the course itself, the process of
learning, and mutual respect between students and the
instructor. Respect for your peers can be as simple as waiting for
another student to finish their observation or refraining from
chatting while someone else is speaking.</p>

<p>Professionalism in the classroom includes:
&ndash; delivering thoughtful work on time
&ndash; interacting respectfully with professors and students
&ndash; participating productively in class discussions and group projects
&ndash; paying attention in class (no texting, no surfing)
&ndash; maintaining a record of punctual class attendance
&ndash; taking responsibility for poor work or missed deadlines</p>

<h4>Attendance</h4>

<p>Attendance is paramount, as lectures, in-class exercises, and class
critiques cannot be replicated for absentees.</p>

<h5>Absences</h5>

<p>The only absences that will be excused are for illnesses requiring you
to be in a doctor&rsquo;s care (a note from your doctor must be provided),
family emergencies, or jury duty.  Even in cases where absences are
excused, if the maximum number of classes is missed (see below),
withdrawal will be recommended due to the amount of in-class content
missed. The following guidelines for penalizing grades due to
unexcused absences will be applied:</p>

<p>Courses that meet ONCE per week:</p>

<p>2 absences = drop one grade (i.e. B+ to B); 3 absences = drop two grades (i.e. B+ to B-)</p>

<p>4 absences = failure or recommended withdrawal, meeting with the department Chair</p>

<p>Courses that meet TWICE per week:</p>

<p>3 absences = drop one grade (i.e. B+ to B); 5 absences = drop two grades (i.e. B+ to B-)</p>

<p>6 absences = failure or recommended withdrawal, meeting with the department Chair</p>

<h5>Lateness</h5>

<p>All classes begin when scheduled. Two late arrivals = one absence.</p>

<p>30 minutes late or 30 minutes leaving early = one absence.</p>

<h3>Grading</h3>

<p>See the &ldquo;Course evaluation&rdquo; section above for an idea of the relative
weights of the various assignments. Grading is a subjective process,
but the main things I look for are: strength of conceptual work,
overall effort, and execution and refinement of your final product. I
will attempt to give you prompt feedback on all submitted work. If you
disagree with my assessment of your work, feel free to talk with me
about it, and I am happy to have a conversation about why you received
the grade you did. Note that &ldquo;having a conversation&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mark will
change your grade if you complain&rdquo; are not the same thing.</p>

<h4>Grading System</h4>

<p>A = 95 &ndash; 100%
A- = 90 &ndash; 94%
B+ = 85 &ndash; 89%
B = 80 &ndash; 84%
B- = 75 &ndash; 79%
C+ = 70 &ndash; 74%
C = 65 &ndash; 69%
C- = 60 &ndash; 64%
D+ = 55 &ndash; 59%
D = 51 &ndash; 54%
D- = 50%
F = 49% and below</p>

<h4>Late Projects</h4>

<p>Late projects will result in the following:</p>

<p>One day late = drop one grade; two days late = drop two grades; three days late = zero.</p>

<h4>Retrieving Student Work</h4>

<p>Students are responsible for retrieving their work. Students are
expected to pick up all work handed in no later than three weeks after
the official last day of classes. If work is not picked up, it will be
assumed that the work is not wanted and will be discarded.</p>

<h3>College Support Resources</h3>

<h4>Student Affairs</h4>

<p>Student Affairs is dedicated to enhancing and complementing students&#8217;
educational experience through programs, services and opportunities
that aid in their personal development. Student Affairs is committed
to community building, co-curricular learning, student support, and
student involvement. If you are a student with a documented disability
and you need accommodations, please make an appointment with the
Director of Student Affairs to discuss these accommodations. All
discussions will remain confidential. Call Student Affairs at
206/726-5003 for information.</p>

<h4>Counseling</h4>

<p>The mission of the Counseling Office (located in room 308) is to
assist students with their academic and artistic pursuits by providing
supportive counseling, referrals and outreach programs that promote
students&#8217; mental health and emotional well being. To schedule an
appointment, call a Counselor at 206/726-5027 or 206/726-5047. If they
are not available, please leave a message on their voicemail and they
will return your call as soon as possible.</p>

<h4>Writing Center</h4>

<p>The Writing Center is a free resource for all students who are
interested in developing writing and reading skills. Located in room
311, the Writing Center is a place where students come to work on
their writing and receive individual guidance, regardless of their
level of development. Trained tutors are available to help students
with such goals as: understanding assignments; brainstorming ideas;
clear and cohesive prose; editing and revision strategies; crafting
thesis statements; ESL resources. Contact Amanda Hill at 206/315-5806
or <a href="&#109;&#97;&#x69;&#x6c;&#116;&#x6f;&#x3a;&#x61;&#104;&#x69;&#x6c;&#x6c;&#x40;&#99;&#111;&#x72;&#110;&#x69;&#x73;&#x68;&#x2e;&#101;&#100;&#x75;&#46;">&#97;&#x68;&#105;&#108;&#108;&#64;&#99;&#111;&#114;&#x6e;&#105;&#x73;&#104;&#x2e;&#101;&#x64;&#x75;&#x2e;</a></p>

<h4>General Safety</h4>

<p>Please inform yourself of safety procedures for this room, including
emergency evacuation routes and the location of the closest first aid
kits and fire extinguishers. Consult the Health &amp; Safety Procedures
booklet posted near doors and eyewash stations. Detailed information
is also provided in the College student handbook.</p>

<p><em>DUE:</em> UX Prototypes for grading application.</p>

<p>Class discussion: Final Assignment Kickoff</p>

<p>What have we learned from doing a series of fast paper prototypes?
What more could we learn by furthering iterating a prototype and
building an interactive version?</p>

<p>Final Project: Choose one of the 4 UX exercises to form the basis for
your final project. For the next 5 weeks you will be building an
interactive prototype based on your paper prototype and
wireframes. Interactive prototypes are valuable because they allow you
to test your assumptions about how users will interact with your
application early in the design/development cycle, before you
potentially waste lots of effort building something no one wants or understands.</p>
