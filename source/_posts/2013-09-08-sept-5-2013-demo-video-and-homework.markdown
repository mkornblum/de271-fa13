#### Homework (Due Tuesday Sept 10)

1. Transform your text file from last week into a web page. At a
   minimum, you should use several different header tags (\<h1\>,
   \<h2\>, etc), a link ("\<a\>" tag) to each of the sites you cite,
   paragraph (\<p\>) tags, etc. Your page should validate, and your
   use of tags should make sense semantically. Use the \<img\> tag to
   include a screenshot of each page you mention.

When you're done, put everything into one directory (your HTML page
plus any image files you used) and submit it to me using Dropbox
before the start of class on Tuesday. 

2. Suggested reading: Chapter 10, "HTML Intro" in "Interact With Web
   Standards". Refer to subsequent chapters as needed.
