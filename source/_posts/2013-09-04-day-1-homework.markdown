DUE Thursday, September 5th.

"Basic Principles" Find two sites or applications that are
examples of successful interactive design and two other sites which
are not successful. Write a couple of paragraphs about each one
detailing why you think it works or doesn't work. Type this up into an
email and send it to me sometime before the start of class on
Thursday.

Ask Yourself:

- What constitutes successful interactive design? Does it engage the
  user? Make them want to buy things? Make them want to participate?
- What are some interactive design features that should be avoided?
- What applications work? Why do they work? Are they easy to use? Are they fun?
- What applitcations fail? Why? Are they difficult to use? Do they not
  do anything useful?
