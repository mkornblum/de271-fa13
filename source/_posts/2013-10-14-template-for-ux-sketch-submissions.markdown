I embedded a suggested template for submitting your UX sketches below,
or you can also find the code
[on Github](https://github.com/mkornblum/de271-fa13/tree/master/source/downloads/code/ux-sketch-template).

You should replace "Your Name" in the header with your actual name,
and fill in the headings, img src attributes, and other text as
appropriate. I have provided you some basic CSS which will keep the
images to a manageable size automatically, so you don't have to worry
about resizing them. Note that this would be bad practice for a site
you were actually putting online, as you don't want to force your site
visitors to download a huge image file, but since we're just using
Dropbox we can afford to go for convenience over perfect correctness.

Please contact me if you have any questions, and feel free to use your
own HTML or CSS as well for your submissions if you'd prefer.
