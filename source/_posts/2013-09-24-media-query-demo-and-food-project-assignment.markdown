#### Example Code:
{% include_code class-6-media-queries-demo/index.html %}

{% include_code class-6-media-queries-demo/style.css %}

#### Food Packaging Project:

1. Rough out a design adapting your food packaging into a website. You
   can do this in the software of your choosing, or by hand. 
2. Take all of the text on your food packaging and structure it into
   semantically correct HTML document(s). You should include all the
   text from the box, including nutrition facts. Possibly helpful:
   [Nutrition Facts template](http://www.jonathoncihlar.com/index.php?Post=nutritiontemplate)
3. The final output of this project will be a small website (more than
   one page, probably 2-4 pages total). It should incorporate the
   branding of whatever food product you started with.

4. Feel free to use any of your previous assignments or any of the
   class example code as baselines to build from.
