UX Assignment #2 – Create wireframes or paper prototypes for an editoral-content site (blog or newspaper type of thing.) Requirements:

- There are two types of users to worry about: editors/writers, and readers.
- Consider how content should be organized – categories? tags? Chronologically? Hot/Popular?
- The goal for the editors is to get as many total “reads” as possible
- Consider how editors will manage the categorization – assume users have no input beyond deciding which stories to read and which ones to ignore.
- How will readers navigate the site and its categories?
