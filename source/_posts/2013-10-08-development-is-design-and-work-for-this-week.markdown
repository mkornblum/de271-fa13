#### Homework for this week:

UX Assignment #1 - Create wireframes or paper prototypes
for a theoretical booking website (car, hotel, airline, that kind of
thing). Required features:

- User must be able to choose a start date for their booking
- If you are designing a car or hotels type of site, user must be
  able to choose an end date for their booking.
- If you are designing an airline site, user must be able to
  select a return flight.

Due 10/15. Plan to turn in a simple HTML file with images or scans
of your sketches or wireframes. Include the user stories you base
your sketches on.
